Hi!

This is a super-small implementation of a memcached client that
only supports a subset of commands. It is not intended for
real world use (currently it only speaks to one server, 
you can't specify the data to store for a key etc).

It's only purpose is to be used by the membase tester
to verify membase behavior. It should be replaced with
a real world memcached client as soon as possible


Cheers,

Trond Norbye
